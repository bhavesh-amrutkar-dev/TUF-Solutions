## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a string **s** , representing a large integer, the task is to return the largest-valued **odd** **integer** (as a string) that is a **substring** of the given string s.

The number returned should **not** have leading **zero's** . But the given input string may have leading zero. (If no odd number is found, then return empty string.)

### Example 1:

**Input:** s = "5347"

**Output:** "5347"

**Explanation:**

The odd numbers formed by given strings are --> 5, 3, 53, 347, 5347.

So the largest among all the possible odd numbers for given string is 5347.

### Example 2:

**Input:** s = "0214638"

**Output:** "21463"

**Explanation:**

The different odd numbers that can be formed by the given string are --> 1, 3, 21, 63, 463, 1463, 21463.

We cannot include 021463 as the number contains leading zero.

So largest odd number in given string is 21463.

### Example 3:

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^3
- '0' <= s[i] <= '9'
